A Loosely typed language is a language that can create variables of different types easily.
 It refers to those programming scripts that do not require defining a variable type.JavaScript is considered a “loosely typed”


A strongly-typed programming language is one in which each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth)
 is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one
 of the data types.Smalltalk, Perl, Ruby, Python, and Self are all "strongly typed"
